# Exploring the Relationship Between Unemployment and Inflation in Italy

## Overview

This project investigates the dynamic between unemployment and inflation rates in Italy. Inspired by the Phillips curve theory—which suggests an inverse relationship between these two economic indicators—this analysis aims to quantify and visualize how fluctuations in unemployment may affect inflation over time. By leveraging Python for data processing, visualization, and regression analysis, the project provides insights into this important economic relationship.

## Motivation

Understanding the interplay between unemployment and inflation is essential for economic policy, forecasting, and business strategy. This project demonstrates:

- How to collect and merge real-world economic data.
- Techniques for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.
- The application of regression analysis to test and quantify economic theories.

The insights from this analysis can aid in economic decision-making and provide a foundation for further research into the Italian economy.
